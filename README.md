## About Me
I completed my M.S. in Computer Science at the Georgia Institute of Technology in May 2025, where I was part of the Systems for Artificial Intelligence Lab (SAIL), working on problems at the intersection of systems and machine learning. Prior to that, I earned my B.Tech in Computer Science and Engineering from IIT Delhi in August 2023.

I am currently a Software R&D Engineer on the Omniverse Runtime team at NVIDIA, where I focus on enhancing the memory management infrastructure of Omniverse Fabricâ€”a high-performance library for efficient creation, modification, and access of USD scene data.
